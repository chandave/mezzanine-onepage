* mezzanine-onepage
One-Page design helper for Mezzanine.

** overview
Some times you need to publish a shiny super cool one-page site on top of nifty bleeding edge JS and SASS technologies.
But you still want your users able to manage their content as usual trough Mezzanine interface, i.e. let them add sections as it was pages.

This micro app provide shortcuts to add content to a one-page designed page, as it was a Mezzanine Page too.
The Only difference is that "subpage" slug will be "parent#subpage" instead of "parent/subpage".

** Usage

- add a container page, wich can contain some rich text or not (two models) ;
- add your pages under it, using the "rich text page in one-page" type.
